# Spam-Mail-Detector-using-SVM

Main.ipynb file contains all the main code for this project. Open that if you wish to read the code.

The dataset utilized for this project is spamham.csv which has been uploaded and also there's another dataset named spam.csv from which I have used some lines as an input to the model so that the model can detect whether the mail is spam or ham.

In this project, I have used the Support Vector Machine Classifier.
